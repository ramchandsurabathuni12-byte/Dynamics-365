By cloning the Git repo to local, you get the model folder to the local repo.
Now, you need to create a link into packages local folder by using the following command.

mklink /d NSI C:\Users\Admin0b1cc5c3c0\source\repos\FDD-002-Report\Metadata\NSI


After this, you will be able to create new objects into the model and see the changes in GitChanges to check-in.
