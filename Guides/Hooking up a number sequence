Hooking Up a number sequence

The Number Sequence framework is used on most Details Master and Details Transaction forms( Worksheet Tables).
ex:- the sales order number is generated through a number sequence 
when the two forms are dealing with the same table we need to write the code twice.
first we create a class that defines our number sequences,and then we will write the code to handle them.

we will need to add an element to the NumberSeqModule base enum. To do so we need to locate this enum from AOT and should create extension.
rename that with our model name.
