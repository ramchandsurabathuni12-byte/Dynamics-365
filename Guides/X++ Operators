Assignment operators 
=   this operator is used to assign the value to the variable.


static void Example1()
{
    int i = 1;
    // Using the = operator. i is assigned the value of i, plus 1. i = 2.
    i = i + 1;
    info(strFmt("Example 1: The result is "), i); // The result is 2.
}

+=  Assign the current variable value plus the expression on the right to the variable on the left.


static void Example2()
{
    int i = 1;
    // Using the += operator. i is assigned the value of i, plus 1. 
    // i = 2 (i = i + 1).
    i += 1;
    info(strFmt("Example 2: The result is "), i); // The result is 2. 
}


++ Inctrements the value by one


static void Example3()
{
    int i = 1;
    // Using the ++ operator. i is incremented by 1, and then 
    // by 1 again in the second statement. The final value of i is 3.
    i++;
    ++i;
    info(strFmt("Example 3: The result is "), i); // The result is 3.
